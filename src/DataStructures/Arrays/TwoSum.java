/*Write a function to solve the Two Sum problem, a popular interview question. Given an
array of integers and a target sum, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to
the target. For example, given the array [2, 7, 11, 15] and the target sum 9, the function
should return [0, 1] because 2 + 7 = 9. */
